# DS Real-time Insights from Social Media Data

In this project, I conducted an analysis of real-time Twitter data to better understand global and local trends using tweet volumes, hashtags, and user mentions. The data was sourced from Twitter's API and contained information on various trending topics and their associated tweet metadata.

Key findings from the analysis include:\
• The identification of trending topics through the intersection of worldwide and local trends.\
• The influence of celebrities on the popularity of certain trends, and their followers' engagement with the tweets.\
• The language distribution of tweets, with English being the most prominent language, followed by Polish, Italian, and Spanish.\
• Insights into user behavior and interests based on their participation in specific trends, which can be further investigated using additional tweet metadata.

Tools and technologies used: Python, JSON, pandas, matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebook.
